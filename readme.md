## Install Raspberry Pi OS (Buster)
Download the Rapsberry Pi OS 'Buster' 32-bit version and install it to an SD card.
Why not 'Bullseye'? At the time of writing Bullseye changed to a different camera stack which didn't work with the infrared camera I had purchased. I suspect bugs will be ironed out eventually.

You can install it to an SD using the Official [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

## Configure the software
Boot up, log in, then update everything
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Turn on the Camera module via raspi-config
```
# Turn on camera via Interface options
sudo raspi-config
```

Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install git ffmpeg libmariadb3 libpq5 libmicrohttpd12 motion python-pip python-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjpeg-dev libz-dev python-pil -y
```

Install motioneye (via pip)
```
pip install motioneye
```

Perform initial motioneye config
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/motioneye
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/motioneye
sudo cp /usr/local/share/motioneye/extra/motioneye.conf.sample /etc/motioneye/motioneye.conf
sudo cp /usr/local/share/motioneye/extra/motioneye.systemd-unit-local /etc/systemd/system/motioneye.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable motioneye
```

Download this repo by cloning it
```
mkdir -p ~/babycam
git clone https://github.com/george-edwards-code/babycam.git ~/babycam/
```

Run the installer
```
~/babycam/install.sh

## Create a website to send to granparents
Register a domain from [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/registrar/search)
Setup a Dynamic DNS 'A' record for your domain. Current instructions can be found [here](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en)
Google will issue a random username and password which will be used to update the DNS using client software.

Setup the DNS updating client software on the Raspberry Pi
```
sudo apt install ddclient -y
# installation comes with a config wizard. Satisfy the wizard with any settings you want, we will overwrite them later.
```

Configure the client appropriately.
```
sudo nano /etc/ddclient.conf
```

Delete everything in that file and replace it with the following, being sure to add your username and password(s) issued by Google
```
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

protocol=googledomains
use=web
server=domains.google.com
daemon=100

# yourdomain.com
login=
password=''
yourdomain.com

# www.yourdomain.com
login=
password=''
www.yourdomain.com
```

Now restart the service
```
sudo systemctl restart ddclient
```

And you can test your config using the following:
```
sudo ddclient -query
```
